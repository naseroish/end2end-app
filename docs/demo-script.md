## üí° Bonus: Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: How long does deployment take?**
> A: Approximately 15-20 minutes for full deployment. SonarCloud analysis takes 5 min, building images 5 min, and Terraform deployment 8-10 min.

**Q: What's the monthly cost?**
> A: Approximately $160-180 USD. Main costs are Application Gateway (~$70), Azure SQL (~$50), and Container Apps (~$40). Costs scale with usage due to serverless architecture.

**Q: How does auto-scaling work?**
> A: Container Apps scale from 1-10 replicas based on HTTP traffic. When requests increase, Azure automatically spins up new container instances. During low traffic, it scales down to 1 replica to save costs.

**Q: Why not use Kubernetes?**
> A: Azure Container Apps provides managed Kubernetes (built on KEDA) without the operational overhead. We get Kubernetes benefits (scaling, health checks) without managing clusters, nodes, or control planes.

**Q: How do you handle database migrations?**
> A: We use SQL scripts (`schema.sql`, `data.sql`) that run on application startup. Spring Boot's schema initialization handles database versioning. For production, we'd use Flyway or Liquibase for safer migrations.

**Q: What about high availability?**
> A: Application Gateway provides load balancing across multiple container replicas. Azure SQL has built-in geo-redundancy. Container Apps automatically replace failed instances. The architecture supports 99.95% SLA.

**Q: How do you manage secrets?**
> A: GitHub Secrets for CI/CD credentials. Azure Key Vault integration possible for enhanced security. Database passwords injected via Terraform variables and container environment variables.

**Q: Can this scale to production traffic?**
> A: Yes. Container Apps can scale to 30+ replicas per app. Application Gateway supports thousands of requests per second. Azure SQL can scale to higher tiers. The architecture is production-grade.
